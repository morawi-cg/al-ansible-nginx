- Most people will glance at your `README`, *maybe* star it, and leave
- Ergo, people should understand instantly what your project is about based on your repo

- HAVE WHITE SPACE
- MAKE IT PRETTY
- GIFS ARE REALLY COOL

## Example  remote ssh setup for vs code(Optional):
   <p> some people may wish to use vscode, now almost a defacto code editor, it has a rather unique feature, </p>
   <p> this is rather neat for a free editor. Below is an example of setting it up to edit on remote host.</p>

   ``` 
      [
       {
         "hostname": "morawi-deployment01",
         "host": "192.168.1.107",
         "port": 22,
         "user": "engineer",
         "key": "/Users/mrawi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub "
       }
      ]
   ```   
 

```javascript
// code away!


```

## Installation

- All the images are based upon the vagrant image of Ubuntu specified in the requirements: 
   `https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/bionic64`
- In principle any machine (Linux,Mac, Windows[10]) should be able to build the structure, components
  required will include Vagrant,Virtual Box, Ansible, Ansible dependencies in the form of Python libraries.
  some Ansible functionality may not be fully workable on windows yet! Need to be checked.
### Vagrant File

- Vagrant file should include the syntax required to pull machine images `https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/bionic64`

### Setup

- If you want more syntax highlighting, format your code like this:

> update and install this package first

```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install ansible vagrant
# Or in the case of Linux RHEL:
$ sudo dnf -y update
$ sudo dnf -y install ansible vagrant
# Or in the case of Linux Debian/Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt -y update
$ sudo apt -y install ansible vagrant

# Ansible can be installed via python pip, less dependencies and this is more portable
```

> now install Python Pip and bower packages

On Ubuntu/Debian
```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ sudo python -m pip install ansible
```
One is advised to use Python3 and its components, 3.6 tends to be the most stable and compatible. Python3 will be retired soon

On RHEL/Centos/Fedora
```shell

$ sudo yum -y update
$ sudo su -
$ subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms  --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
$ yum -y install @development
$ yum -y install rh-python36
 
$ yum -y install rh-python36-numpy  rh-python36-scipy rh-python36-python-tools rh-python36-python-six 
```
