> How to automate the creation of an Nginx load balanced pair of Nginx web servers  

> Deployable on a Linux host 

> include terms/tags that can be searched

**Key points**

- Compatibility , (Python versions and deprecated Ansible syntax)
- Different ways to install automation tools depending on the deployment targets 
- Know your Ansible! "ansible-playbook playbooks/PLAYBOOK_NAME.yml --flush-cache" known issue
- Advantages: virtual env offer flexibility: 'venv ,virtualenv' package for Python on Unix & Windows

- To understand more about the system, glance at the `README`, *maybe* star it, or comment!
- It is constructed so that, people should understand instantly what this project is about based on this repo, the images and the description. Please leave a comment or a suggestion for future improvements.


> Tips

- Use Python virtual env, helps mitigate the delay of making big errors
- Use test inventory use the 'i' key to help 'ansible -i /etc/ansible/al-project webservers -m ping'
- Diagrams and images, a picture is a thousand word! (Many languages in one!)
- Use galaxy to create roles 'ansible-galaxy init al-webcluster-of-3'

## Example  remote ssh setup for vs code(Optional):
   <p> some people may wish to use vscode, now almost a defacto code editor, it has a rather unique feature, </p>
   <p> this is rather neat for a free editor. Below is an example of setting it up to edit on remote host.</p>

   ``` 
      [
       {
         "hostname": "morawi-deployment01",
         "host": "192.168.1.107",
         "port": 22,
         "user": "engineer",
         "key": "/Users/mrawi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub "
       }
      ]
   ```   
 

```javascript
// code away!


```

## Installation

- All the images are based upon the vagrant image of Ubuntu specified in the requirements: 
   `https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/bionic64`
- In principle any machine (Linux,Mac, Windows[10]) should be able to build the structure, components
  required will include Vagrant,Virtual Box, Ansible, Ansible dependencies in the form of Python libraries.
  some Ansible functionality may not be fully workable on windows yet! Need to be checked.
### Vagrant File

- Vagrant file should include the syntax required to pull machine images `https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/bionic64`

### Setup

- Check that virtual box is installed, operational and tested manually via starting a vm:
- Install vagrant and ansible, refer to the help below

```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install ansible vagrant
# Or in the case of Linux RHEL:
$ sudo dnf -y update
$ sudo dnf -y install ansible vagrant
# Or in the case of Linux Debian/Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt -y update
$ sudo apt -y install ansible vagrant

# Ansible can be installed via python pip, less dependencies and this is more portable
```

> now install Python Pip and bower packages

On Ubuntu/Debian
```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ sudo python -m pip install ansible
```
One is advised to use Python3 and its components, 3.6 tends to be the most stable and compatible. Python3 will be retired soon

On RHEL/Centos/Fedora
```shell

$ sudo yum -y update
$ sudo su -
$ subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms  --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
$ yum -y install @development
$ yum -y install rh-python36
 
$ yum -y install rh-python36-numpy  rh-python36-scipy rh-python36-python-tools rh-python36-python-six 
```
